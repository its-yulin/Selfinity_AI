## üí° Inspiration
Our project was inspired by a critical realization that resonated in both our personal and professional realms ‚Äì the challenge of efficiently managing and accessing data. 

In our personal lives, valuable hours that could be dedicated to loved ones are often lost in managing emails, social media, and numerous digital tasks. This universal challenge led us to envision a unified, AI-driven tool designed to streamline the management of digital information.
